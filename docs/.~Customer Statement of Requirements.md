# Customer Statement of Requirements

For most people today, cooking or experimenting with food is a challenge because there is just not enough time in one’s busy schedule to whip together a tasteful meal for the family or loved one in any occasion. Someone may have all the ingredients for a chocolate soufflé but never be able to make it because they never thought to search for a recipe with that specific ingredient or spice which they already have in their cabinet. Similarly, when someone finds a recipe they must rely on the reviews of strangers to decide if the recipe will be tasty. For many Americans, when something is too difficult or time consuming we have little desire to do or learn it; furthermore, with cooking or baking, one might believe there are more important things to spend their time on. This is an issue that needs to be resolved. 

For most, cost and convenience are also factors—which may be partly why fast food restaurants are so popular.  They try to offer the most “bang for your buck”, are easy and fast to build a meal, and are located on practically every corner; however, they can also be a burden on one’s waist size and wallet. While some establishments may offer a “healthier choice” menu or entrée, this “healthier choice” may not be an actual healthy choice especially when almost 60% of young adults agree that they eat at fast food restaurants at least weekly. There is a reason that the connection between eating out and obesity is so prevalent. If cooking at home was cheaper and just as easy and fast as ordering in or going out, more people would stay in. 

To remedy this problem, we introduce Ava—your partner in crime to making a delicious home-cooked meal and your sous-chef in the kitchen. Ava is all about convenience and simplicity. She can help a person with deciding what to make for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and dessert in a simple, fast, and powerful way. It is understandable that making a new meal can be a frustrating experience which is why Ava will be there to provide someone with step by step instructions. For those who are worried about the cost, a person will not be forced to go grocery shopping for certain ingredients to fulfill a recipe because they can search for recipes based on what is already in their cabinets. 

A user will be able to put their ingredients into a pantry to keep track of what they have available to use in recipes. Users will have the option to make an account to store all their information so the next time they want to search for a meal based on cuisine or the time-of-day or the ingredients they have, or just view the ingredients they have leftover, it will not all have to be retyped or entered in. When someone finds a recipe, they will no longer have to question whether the recipe is a desirable choice or not because they will be able to see quality reviews based on a five-star rating as well as suggestions made by real people on how they changed or bettered the recipe when they made it. 

Similarly, if someone finds a recipe that they think one of their friends would like, they have the option to share it with them. The user will also be able to keep track of their own favorite recipes by saving or bookmarking them to build their own recipe book and view or cook later. This will save time for those users who may have time on the weekend to plan for meals during the week, when their schedule becomes more laborious and there is little or no time to prepare dinner,etc. 

Administration will be able to use Ava to edit or add recipes and keep track of the most viewed recipes. For the users who just want to add a side dish or dessert to complete a meal, Ava offers suggestions with recipes to make a full balanced meal. Users will also be able to see the most popular recipes viewed by others in case they want to mix up their normal meal plans and try something new. Ava is a powerful resource that can maximize the cooking experience in an easy and fun way. She will be user friendly and make our users want to come back time and time again.
